#### Disentangle your job from your calling

Research is a funny thing because it can be both a job and a calling.

The relationship between the two is complicated. Some people seem lucky enough to be able do both, but in practice, this isn't as common as you think. These days, professors spend much less time on research than they would like to, let alone, on research that they feel passionate about.

In this blog, we aim to disentangle the two positions:
- research as a job, and
- research as a calling

and explore if it's possible to do curiosity-driven research even if it's not your job.

We're not against the academic path. Our goal is to do curiosity-driven research, and becoming an academic is one of the most common ways to do this. But our mantra is that there is no free lunch: even professors spend most of their time doing stuff they don't want to do. So with that in mind, might we consider other alternatives?

If you would like to design your life in a way that gives you the resources (skills, time, money, community) to do research for the sheer pleasure of it, then this blog is for you. But remember: there is no free lunch. Building the life that you want is a deliberate pursuit that takes time and work.
