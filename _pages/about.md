Research is a funny thing because it can be both a job and a calling.

The relationship between the two is complicated. Some people seem lucky enough to do both, but in practice, this isn't as common as you think.

These days, professors spend much less time on research than they would like to, let alone, on research that they feel passionate about.

Researchers who wanted a life that gave them time to think deeply about their chosen subject find themselves feeling short-changed.

So with that in mind, might we consider other alternatives?

At <b>Indie Research</b>, we aim to disentangle the two positions:
<ul>
  <li>research as a job, and </li>
  <li>research as a calling</li>
</ul>
and explore if it's possible to do curiosity-driven research even if it's not your job.

Our goal is to develop an actionable framework for acquiring the resources needed (skills, time, money, community) to do research for the sheer pleasure of it.

You can join us on this journey by following our [blog](./blog). Or you can check back in a few months to see how the framework is coming along.
